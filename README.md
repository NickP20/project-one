Questions
1. We are looking at how cause of death by diseases counts changed from 2019 (March - Feb 2020) vs. 2020 (March - Feb 2021) with the onset of Covid
    -Is age a factor in cause of death (age distribution for different causes of death)

    -Does seasonality or location impact death by certain causes

4. How did the onset of Covid 19 impact the distribution of cause of death (2019 vs. 2020)

5. Covid only vs. covid with underlying conditions (2020 data only)

6. Age distribution for Covid
